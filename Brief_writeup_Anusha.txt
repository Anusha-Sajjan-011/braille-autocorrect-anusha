-->Overview
This project implements a Python-based Braille Auto-Correct and Suggestion System.
It helps users typing Braille via a QWERTY keyboard by detecting and correcting errors in input, such as mistyped, missing, or extra keys.

The system works by:

Converting QWERTY key combinations to Braille dot binary patterns.
Representing entire Braille words as sequences of binary patterns.
Comparing user input with a dictionary of known Braille words.
Suggesting the closest valid word using the Levenshtein distance algorithm.



-🧠-> Braille Input Format
Braille characters are typed using the keys:

D, W, Q, K, O, P corresponding to Braille dots 1 to 6

Example:
"DK" = D (dot 1) + K (dot 4) → Braille letter C (in binary: 100100)



-->⚙️ How It Works
Each Braille character (key combo) is converted into a 6-bit binary string.

A full word is represented as a sequence of binary patterns (one per letter).

Input sequence is compared to known words using Levenshtein Distance.

The word with the lowest distance (i.e., closest match) is returned as a suggestion.



-->🧪 Test Case Example
Input:
["DOP", "D", "DK", "DKO", "DOP"]

Expected Output:
hello (with distance: 0)



-->📈 Performance
The algorithm runs efficiently for small to medium dictionaries.

Uses a custom Levenshtein implementation (no external libraries), making it portable and lightweight.

Easily extendable to real-time input or larger wordlists using Trie structures.



-->🛠️ Future Enhancements (Optional Bonus Ideas)
Add real-time correction via a CLI or web interface (Flask).

Include Braille contractions and multiple language support.

Build a learning model that improves suggestions based on user history.
